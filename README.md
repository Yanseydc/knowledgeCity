Testing Project 

## Installation
### Apache

To download the webserver in a easy installation just use this link [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html). And download the installer compatible with your OS.

## Downloading the project
To clone the project go to the path ***C:\xampp\htdocs***, then you can clone the project there. Make sure to use the Development branch, because right now that is the base project.

Make sure to have internet connection, 'cause at the moment I'm using some CDN's (jquery and bootstrap)
## Usage 
To start apache and mysql services, you will hace a control panel for both, so just find the xampp control panel in your computer, and start the apache and mysql service.

## Database
You just have to import the .sql file that is in this project, and in your connection just make sure to have user root and no password.
